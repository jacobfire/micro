retry - just have a series of repeatable retries if we have not got a response after first time
deadline and timeout - similar to retry but we have deadline
hedge - if we have several instances of DB we send request on them for better performance and cancel requet if we got answer
rate limit - we start limiting qty of requests if we have more than a threshold
circuit breaker - we stop processing requests if we have a flood of request we cant process
